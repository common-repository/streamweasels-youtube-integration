== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display YouTube Shorts from a specific YouTube Channel? =

To display YouTube shorts, simply set the channel ID and set the layout to Shorts showcase like this:

[sw-youtube channel="UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug" layout="showcase"]

= How do I display YouTube videos from a specific YouTube Channel? =

[sw-youtube channel="UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug"]

= How do I display YouTube videos from a specific YouTube Playlist? =

[sw-youtube playlist="UUAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug"]

= How do I display YouTube live streams from a list of YouTube Channels? =

[sw-youtube livestream="UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw,UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug"]

= How do I create a YouTube API key? =

This plugin requires a YouTube API key in order to pull data from YouTube. An API key from YouTube comes with an API quota of 10,000 units per day. For most sites, this YouTube API key quota will be enough to display all the YouTube channel content you wish.
